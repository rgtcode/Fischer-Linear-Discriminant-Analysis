# Fischer-Linear-Discriminant-Analysis
Here FLDA have been performed on synthetic,Image,speech as well as the handwritten dataset
FLDA is similar dimensionality reduction technique as pca.The only difference is that in pca we find out the direction where we have the maximum variation but in case of the flda we find out the direction of maximum discrimination.

## Dataset used
1.Speech data
2.Handwritten data
3. Image data
4. Synthetic data
